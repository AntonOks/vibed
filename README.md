Vibe.d tutorial files for download

Hi, this is a tutorial on Vibe.d. I find there is a dearth of tutorials on Vibe.d. Kai Nacke's book is in dire need of an update, so I wrote this book while trying to learn Vibe.d again. I am no expert on either Vibe.d or D so feel free to make changes to the .docx file. Thanks!

The newer version is viewable as a web page here:
